        <h2>The Factoring Calculator</h2>
        <p>This is a factoring calculator developed by David Sai. Put in a quadratic equation, for example: 6x^2 + 8x + 2</p>
        <p>and it will return the factored form (2x+1)(3x+2) and (x+1)(6x+2). The reason I decided to make a factoring calculator</p>
        <p>is that when I was learning how to factor quadratics, I constantly found that there were not many available.</p>
        <h2>How to use:</h2>
        <p>Before you use this, I highly recommend learning how to factor polynomials first. It is always better to know how to do it yourself</p>
        <p>Some good resources are:</p>

          <p>If none of those help, scroll below the calculator for an explanation by me (It probably won't be as good as the ones I listed above though). </p>
        
        <p>There is a green button below with an arrow pointing right. Click the button, then scroll down to the darker section to input your numbers.</p>
        <p>Follow the instructions that are there.</p>

   <h2>How to factor polynomials</h2>
   <p>First, you should look at the first term (ax^2). If "a" is 1, then follow the steps below.</p>
   <ol>
        <li>Look at the second and third terms, and take the coefficients of both of them</li>
        <li>Figure out what two numbers multiply to the third coefficient (c) and add to the second (b). This will take a fair amount of trial and error.</li>
        <li>Take those two numbers and put them into (x + _)(x + _)</li>
   </ol>
   <p>If the first coefficient is not 1, follow these steps.</p>
   <ol>
        <li>Multiply the first coefficient and the third coefficient</li>
        <li>Figure out which two numbers multiply to this product and add to the second coefficient. Let's call these numbers m and n.</li>
        <li>Put all the variables you know in a grid pattern like the one below.</li>
        <img src = "dia.png" height="400" width="800">
        <li>We don't know the variables U, W, Y, or Z yet, but we can figure that out</li>
        <li>Think of it as a multiplication table. Fill in U, W, Y, and Z.</li>
        <li>Your answer will be (w + u)(y + z)</li>
   </ol>
